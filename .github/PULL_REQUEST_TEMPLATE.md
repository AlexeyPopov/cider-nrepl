Before submitting a PR make sure the following things have been done:

- [ ] The commits are consistent with our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] You've added tests to cover your change(s)
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] The new code is not generating reflection warnings
- [ ] You've updated the README (if adding/changing middleware)

Keep in mind that new cider-nrepl builds are automatically deployed to Clojars
once a PR is merged, but **only** if the CI build is green.

*If you're just starting out to hack on cider-nrepl you might find
this [article](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/nrepl.html) and the
"Design" section of the README extremely useful.*

Thanks!
